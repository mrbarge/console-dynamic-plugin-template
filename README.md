# OpenShift Console Plugin Template

This project is a minimal template for writing a new OpenShift Console dynamic
plugin. It requires OpenShift 4.11. For an example of a plugin that works with
OpenShift 4.10, see the `release-4.10` branch.

[Dynamic plugins](https://github.com/openshift/console/tree/master/frontend/packages/console-dynamic-plugin-sdk)
allow you to extend the
[OpenShift UI](https://github.com/openshift/console)
at runtime, adding custom pages and other extensions. They are based on
[webpack module federation](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/module-federation/).
Plugins are registered with console using the `ConsolePlugin` custom resource
and enabled in the console operator config by a cluster administrator.

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) are required
to build and run the example. To run OpenShift console in a container, either
[Docker](https://www.docker.com) or [podman 3.2.0+](https://podman.io) and
[oc](https://console.redhat.com/openshift/downloads) are required.

## Getting started

After cloning this repo, you should update the plugin metadata such as the
plugin name in the `consolePlugin` declaration of [package.json](package.json).

```json
"consolePlugin": {
  "name": "console-dynamic-plugin-template",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "displayName": "OpenShift Console Dynamic Plugin Template",
  "description": "Minimal Console Dynamic Plugin",
  "exposedModules": {
    "ExamplePage": "./components/ExamplePage"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "@console/pluginAPI": "*"
  }
}
```

The template adds a single example page in the Home navigation section. The
extension is declared in the [console-extensions.json](console-extensions.json)
file and the React component is declared in
[src/components/ExamplePage.tsx](src/components/ExamplePage.tsx).

You can run the plugin using a local development environment or build an image
to deploy it to a cluster.

## Development

### Option 1: Local

In one terminal window, run:

1. `yarn install`
2. `yarn run start`

In another terminal window, run:

1. `oc login` (requires [oc](https://console.redhat.com/openshift/downloads) and an [OpenShift cluster](https://console.redhat.com/openshift/create))
2. `yarn run start-console` (requires [Docker](https://www.docker.com) or [podman 3.2.0+](https://podman.io))

This will run the OpenShift console in a container connected to the cluster
you've logged into. The plugin HTTP server runs on port 9001 with CORS enabled.
Navigate to <http://localhost:9000/example> to see the running plugin.

## Docker image

Before you can deploy your plugin on a cluster, you must build an image and
push it to an image registry.

1. Build the image:

   ```sh
   make build
   ```

2. Push the image:

   ```sh
   make push
   ```

OR

3. Build and Push the image:

   ```sh
   make build-push
   ```

## Deployment on cluster

To deploy on the cluster, can simply run the below command:

```bash
oc apply -f manifest.yaml
```

## Linting

This project adds prettier, eslint, and stylelint. Linting can be run with
`yarn run lint`.

The stylelint config disallows hex colors since these cause problems with dark
mode (starting in OpenShift console 4.11). You should use the
[PatternFly global CSS variables](https://patternfly-react-main.surge.sh/developer-resources/global-css-variables#global-css-variables)
for colors instead.

The stylelint config also disallows naked element selectors like `table` and
`.pf-` or `.co-` prefixed classes. This prevents plugins from accidentally
overwriting default console styles, breaking the layout of existing pages. The
best practice is to prefix your CSS classnames with your plugin name to avoid
conflicts. Please don't disable these rules without understanding how they can
break console styles!
